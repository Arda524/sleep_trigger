## Technical Details

The application uses Windows API calls through P/Invoke:
- `SetSuspendState` from `powrprof.dll` for sleep functionality
- `Process.Start` with `shutdown` command for shutdown and restart operations

## Security Note

This application requires system-level permissions to perform power management operations. Always ensure you save your work before using shutdown or restart commands.
